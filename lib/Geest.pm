=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a port of kage (https://github.com/cookpad/kage) to perl. 
Why does this exist? Because I felt like writing it, duh.

In its essence, this module is just an HTTP proxy server. It receives requests
from the client, and broadcasts the requests to multiple backends.

Why would you want this? For example, you can put this in front of your
staging app server while you're refactoring your code. Geest can be configured
to access your production server AND your refactored server, and to show
any differences in the content received. This way you can avoid breaking
your existing code.

=head1 HOW GEEST PROCESSES REQUESTS

Backends consist of one "master", and one or more others. The response received
from the master is preferred over other backends, but in cases where you 
specified to retrieve from backends other than the master, the fastest 
response is used.

Backends can be registered through the C<add_backend()> method (or 
C<add_master()>, if you are adding a master backend)

    $server->add_backend(name_of_backend => (
        host => ...,
        port => ...
    ));

By default all backends are used, but you may change this by setting the
C<select_backend> hook:

    $server->on(select_backend => sub {
        my ($request) = @_; # HTTP::Request object
        ...
    });

The callback receives the HTTP::Request object representing the original
client request. You can, for example, choose to send all GET requests to
servers A and B, and everything else to only B

    $server->on(select_backend => sub {
        my ($request) = @_;
        if ($request->method eq 'GET') {
            return [ 'A', 'B' ];
        } else {
            return [ 'A' ];
        }
    });

The proxy asynchronously connects to the hosts specified by the method
above, and then send them the same request. If you want to change the
requests being sent to each backend, you can do so in the C<munge_request>
hook:

    $server->on(munge_request => sub {
        my ($backend, $request) = @_;
        # Do what you will to $request
    });

When the backend responds, the response is accumulated in memory. If
the list of backends contains the "master" backend, then the client will
receive the response when the proxy receives a response from the master.
Otherwise, the first response is used to reply to the client.

When all the backends are finished, the C<backend_finished> hook is called.
You can do any verification you need to do in this hook. For example,
the most simple check would be to check the difference between the
responses:

    use Text::Diff;

    $server->on(backend_finished => sub {
        my ($responses) = @_;
        # $responses = {
        #    name_of_backend => {
        #       backend  => ...,  # Geest::Backend object
        #       response => ...,  # HTTP::Response object
        #       request  => ...,  # HTTP::Request object
        #    },
        #    ...
        # };
        if (! $responses->{prod} || ! $responses->{dev}) {
            return;
        }

        my $data_prod = $responses->{prod}->{response}->decoded_content;
        my $data_dev  = $responses->{dev}->{response}->decoded_content;
        if ($data_prod ne $data_dev) {
            # You probably want to check that both responses are
            # content_type -> text/* before running diff()
            print STDERR diff(\$data_prod, $data_dev);
        }
    });

And voila, you get to check if you have any differences between your current
development version and the production server.

=head1 DEBUG

When you set C<GEEST_DEBUG> to a non-zero value, debug output will be available.
